CHANGE LOG for DAVEtools

V 0.9.4: Added new utilities: DAVE2POST, to generate POST-II input
	decks and code sections; and DAVE2OTIS, to generate OTIS4
	input decks.  Added FORTRAN and C code snippet writers, to
	support these.  Added selectionFlag to Block and
	selectOutput(), getSelectedBlocks() to Model.  Tweaked tests
	to run under Windows XP. Upgraded for use with NetBeans 7.1.1
	and Java SE 1.6. Fixed DAVE2SL incompatibility with
	Matlab/Simulink 2011b. Bug fix for inequality comparison
	operator in Simulink block.

V 0.9.3: Added tally of checkcases to DAVE's statistics summary (when
	used with the -c option). Added support for UML diagram
	generation (with two open-source packages) for DAVEtools
	development. Separated this change log from the readme
	file. Fixed some annoyances related to missing DTDs and/or
	network being unavailable. Added support for MathML 'max',
	'min', 'ceiling', and 'floor' elements.

V 0.9.2: Corrected bug in DAVE that didn't recognize use of binary
        minus in MathML2 calculations; fixed bug whereby anonymous
        tables shared the same matlab setup data; corrected sense of
        return codes from DAVE and DAVE2SL. Improved integration test
        framework. Corrected bug in ModelSweeper that caused program
        to crash if no checkcases were defined.

V 0.9.1: Added support for minValue and maxValue attributes of
        variableDef as allowed in DAVE-ML 2.0 RC 4; fixed error
        reporting in creation script generation (aborts were returning
        exit status 0 but now report 1).

V 0.9.0: Changed to support the default DAVE-ML namespace (xmlns);
	added entity refs to make Eclipse IDE happy; changed for using
	'build' subdirectories to 'bin' to make Eclipse convention;
	fleshed out ant build.xml file to rely less on makefiles (but
	a makefile is still needed to run the app_tests of DAVE2SL).

	Corrected the inability of dave to parse MathML 'piecewise'
	elements with more than one 'piece.'

 	Distribution format switched to zip from tar to be more PC
 	friendly.

	Build system switched to Ant from Make (but some hybrid make
	functionality exists, to some version of make is still
	required).

	Source code management system now uses 'git' instead of
	Subversion.

	Now producing a single DAVEtools.jar that includes all
	products for convenience, including dave, dave2sl, modelsweeper,
	xerces and jdom .jar file contents. Slightly different syntax
	used to invoke DAVE2SL (default jar entry point) and DAVE.

Summary of changes since DAVEtools v 0.8.0:

V 0.8.1a: Added support for MathML logical operations (not, and, or,
          xor); switched to ant for build instead of make

Summary of changes since DAVEtools v 0.7.2:

V 0.8.0b: Incorporated NASA open-source license agreement, copyright info

V 0.8.0a: added 'csymbol' element extension support for 'atan2';
	  now checking input arguments for -c|--count forms in DAVE.

         Added support for an immediate <ci> and <cn> sub-elements in a
         <math> element; this is valid MathML but was not supported in
         DAVEtools until now. This allows direct assignment of a
         variable (in the <variableDef> element to either another
         variable (using the content identifier, <ci>, element) or a
         constant numeric value (using the content number, <cn>,
         element). 

	 Verification tests that fail now gives more details on which
	 output parameters fail to compare.

Summary of changes since DAVEtools v 0.6.0 (not released):

V 0.7.2: Developed 'dist' makefile target.

V 0.7.1: Moved data into model workspace instead of base workspace.

V 0.7.0: Now generating 'create' script instead of .mdl directly to
	work around bug in Simulink interpreter regarding order of
	output ports. (rev 75)

Summary of changes since DAVEtools v 0.5.0:

V 0.6.0: Mostly updates to documentation; no major changes.

V 0.5.7: Breakpoint vectors are now written into the same structure as
	 function tables, with _pts appended to name of BP block.

V 0.5.6: Table contents are now written into structure via setup
         script with model-unique name to support multiple models with
         similar structure.

V 0.5.5: Now writes Simulink 6.2 (R14SP2) models

V 0.5.4: No change; moved to new SVN repository

V 0.5.3: Removed xerces as a necessary separate package, and removed
JDOM b-9 from the distribution, per legal beagles. This required
modifying DAVE.java to pass in a base URI for the input file.

V 0.5.2: Wrote Theory of Operation (package.html) for DAVE2SL in
javadoc. Added switches to DAVE2SL for library, enabled subsystem,
version 4 or 5 Simulink, and clip warnings on/off. Fixed bug in sum
block. Some javadoc improvements.

V 0.5.1: Generate Simulink as a subsystem for cleanliness. Corrected
spacing bug in Simulink diagram; adjusted table lookup blocks so
multiple input ports have at least 15 pixel spacing.
